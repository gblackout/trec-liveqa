S'insomnia (special case). hi, im 40 years old male. i was suffering from social anxiety since i was child.  last year, i decided to go to a psychologist. she advised me to practice meditation, mindfulness and cbt as well.  she explained to me the great positive impact of the meditation, mindfulness on the brain activity (neuroplasticity). since then, ive been practicing these techniques. the result was awesome. i no longer suffer from my social anxiety and my life has completely changed to the positive side. no more worry, stress, anxiety, etc.  but at the same time, i started to suffer from chronic insomnia until now. of course, im always in touch with my psychiatrist who has prescribed me the necessary and still following me up. even tough, my insomnia doesnt improved.  unfortunately, nobody can determine the real cause of my insomnia.  if i know the cause, ill do my best to find the key to resolve this problem.  according to my mentioned story, can you help me to find the real cause of my insomnia?   thank you, your answer is very appreciable and important to me.    .'

S'stroke due to aneurysm?. my son had a hemmorhagic stroke at 4 weeks of age....he is now 31 years old.  in the week leading up to the stroke he had a head cold and i had been giving  him infant cold drops.  after he had the stroke the doctors at the time could only say that it was a fluke and would probably never happen again.  the reason for the stroke has haunted me ever since.  now we just recently found out that my mother has a cerebral aneurysm and they say this can be hereditary.  so my question now is did my son have an aneurysm that burst or was it caused by a blood clot?...is there anyway of knowing or getting an answer to that question after the event has happened?'
