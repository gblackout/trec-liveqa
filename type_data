S'customer service request.  my daughter has turner syndrome but shes beaten all odds. she developed on our own, got her period on her own, she is now pregnant on her own with identical twins. my question is can she have normal children or do they have more of a chance of having turner syndrome.  my daughter has been tested many times to confirm her diagnosis of turner syndrome and she is a full xo not mosaic but still does not display many of the characteristics. again, i am just questioning the safety of the pregnancy and the health of the babies. thank you for your help'

VMy mother has had epidermolysis bullosa for many years. She recently underwent total knee replacement surgery and another surgery to flush out a staph infection and has had wound healing problems, including pus, redness and fever. We are concerned about complications from infection and wanted to know if there is any research related to wound healing in patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Where can we read more information about treatment? How can we find a physician who is knowledgeable about this condition?

VMy wife was diagnosed with relapsing polychondritis over 6 years ago. Her ear flares up about 2-3 times a year. In the beginning it went away on its own; now she takes prednisone but only during the flare. Our doctor says the next step would be methotrexate but before that she'd be on daily prednisone. The disease doesn't seem to be progressing and CT and PET scans indicate no other damage. Is there something more we should be doing such as diet supplements or other medications?

He has had a liver transplant at 6 months due to liver failure, coagulopathy, ascites, protein losing enteropathy (?), failure to thrive, and hypoglycemia. CT and MRI do not show any brain abnormalities. He does not yet crawl or stand on his own, possibly because he was hospitalized for four months. I am worried about his developmental delay. He does have minimal delay in speech.
